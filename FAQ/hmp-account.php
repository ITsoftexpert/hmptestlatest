            On HireMyProfile, there is no specific limit to how many job
            requests you
            can respond to daily. Freelancers are encouraged to apply to
            as many
            opportunities as they feel fit their skills and expertise.
            However, we
            recommend focusing on quality over quantity to maximize your
            chances of
            success and build strong client relationships.

        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Eligibility to Work with Clients:</strong>
                After
                activation, you become eligible to
                take up jobs directly from the client. This ensures that
                only
                qualified

                enhance
                your visibility on the
                platform. Clients searching for freelancers within your
                expertise
                are more
                likely to find and consider you for their projects.</li>

            <li> <strong>Platform Features Become Accessible:</strong>
                Activation
                unlocks access to additional
